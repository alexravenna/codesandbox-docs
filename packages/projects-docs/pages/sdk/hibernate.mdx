# Hibernate Sandboxes

Hibernating a Sandbox allows you to stop its running costs and resume it at a later point. When hibernating the Sandbox it will produce a snapshot with memory and disk, but depending on cluster load, and days passed, the persistence will change its state.

| **State**   | **Resume Time** | **Description**                                   |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Memory/Disk | 0.5–2 seconds   | Memory and disk from snapshot                     |
| Disk        | 5–20 seconds    | Disk from snapshot, will run setup tasks          |
| Archived    | 20–60 seconds   | Disk from cold storage with, will run setup tasks |

## Hibernating a Sandbox

```ts
await sdk.sandboxes.hibernate('sandbox-id');
```
