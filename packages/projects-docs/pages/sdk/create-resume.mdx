# Create Sandbox

Sandboxes are the main building blocks of the CodeSandbox SDK. Each one represents a single project that you can run, fork, and modify.

Every Sandbox is backed by a Firecracker VM, and is completely isolated and persisted. Providing you with a secure environment to run untrusted code.

## Creating a Sandbox

To create a sandbox, call `sandbox.create()`:

```ts
import { CodeSandbox } from '@codesandbox/sdk'
const sdk = new CodeSandbox();

const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create();
```

<Callout>
By default Sandboxes are `unlisted` and can be accessed and forked by anyone with a url. If you want to create a private sandbox you can pass `privacy: 'private'`, which requires host tokens to access the exposed ports.
</Callout>

If no argument is provided to `sandbox.create()`, we'll create a sandbox based on our [Universal](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/universal-pcz35m) template on CodeSandbox. You can also pass in a specific template id from [our collection of templates](/sdk/snapshot-library) or by creating your own snapshot using our [Snapshot Builder](/sdk/snapshot-builder). Additionally you can choose other sources like [Git](/sdk/sandbox#git) or [Files](/sdk/sandbox#files).

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create({
    id: 'some-sandbox-id',

    // Optional properties
    title: 'my-sandbox',
    description: 'My sandbox',
    tags: ['my-tag'],

    // Public, unlisted or private
    privacy: 'private',

    // Collection folder on Dashboard
    path: '/users/some-user-folder',

    // Prefer closest cluster. Follows ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 codes.
    ipcountry: "US",

    // What VM Tier to use for the Sandbox
    vmTier: VMTier.Pico,

    // How quickly the sandbox should hibernate after inactivity.
    // Defaults to 300 seconds for free users, 1800 seconds for
    // pro users. Maximum is 86400 seconds (1 day).
    hibernationTimeoutSeconds: 120_000,

    // Configure if Sandbox should wake up automatically on HTTP
    // or requests or WebSocket connections
    automaticWakeupConfig: {
        http: true,
        websocket: true
    }
})
```

## Sandbox Properties

The `sandbox` object represents the instance of a sandbox running in our infrastructure. The methods detailed below require the Sandbox to be running.

Each Sandbox has the following properties, with information about it's own instance:

- `id`: The unique identifier of the sandbox.
- `isUpToDate`: Whether the sandbox is up to date with the latest agent version.
- `cluster`: The cluster the sandbox is running on.
- `bootupType`: The type of bootup, `RUNNING`, `CLEAN`, `RESUME` or `FORK`.

## Resume an Existing Sandbox

To resume an existing sandbox from hibernation and connect to it call: `sdk.sandboxes.resume(id)`:

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.resume('sandbox-id');
```

<Callout>
Sandboxes that have been dormant for a week may take longer to start as they will need to run their [setup](/sdk/setup) before resuming. 
</Callout>
