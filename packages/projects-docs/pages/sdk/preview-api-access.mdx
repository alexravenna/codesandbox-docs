# Preview API Access

But if you are using the [Browser Preview API](./browser-previews), you will need to set up your allowed preview hosts. These are the hosts where you will be mounting the iframe, for example `localhost:5173` or `company-domain.com`. Configuring these hosts using the SDK CLI. The hosts are stored on your workspace and applies to all your Sandboxes.

```bash
$ csb preview-hosts list

$ csb preview-hosts add :host

$ csb preview-hosts remove :host

$ csb preview-hosts clear
```

The `:host` is a JavaScript RegEx. So you can set your host as: `"my-project-.*-.*.vercel.app"` for example (Note the quotes).

**Cache Latency**: Trusted preview hosts have a cache latency of 5 minutes. Changes to the trusted host configuration may take up to 5 minutes to propagate.
