# Create Session

There are currently two types of sessions. A "server session" and a "browser session".

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()

// Immediately create a session on the server
const session = await sandbox.connect()

// Or pass a browser session to the browser and connectToSandbox
const browserSession = await sandbox.createBrowserSession()
```

By default a session is bound to a user called `pitcher-host`. This user has write access to any API. We refer to this session as the "global" session.

<Callout>
When you run `whoami`, it will say that you are `root`. That's because we run every session inside a Docker container where you are `root`. However the container itself is started as the user of your session.
</Callout>

## Dedicated Sessions

You should use dedicated sessions for your users. This ensures privacy and isolation between users. You can configure a session to have specific permissions, git access, tokens to securily access private hosts and even environment variables.

### Permissions

By default a user has `write` access, but you can configure a session to have `read` access.

```ts
// Now configure a session that only has read access to the sandbox
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = await sandbox.connect({
  id: 'anonymous',
  permission: 'read'
})

// I have access to the normal sandbox api, but I only have read access
// This means I cannot write files or open shells, but I _can_ read them
await session.fs.writeTextFile('test.txt', 'Hello World'); // This will throw an error.
await session.fs.readTextFile('test.txt'); // This will work.
```

### Git

Passing git details allows the user to use git commands inside the sandbox.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = await sandbox.connect({
    id: 'some-user-reference,
    git: {

        email: 'foo@bar.com',
        accessToken: '...',
        provider: 'github.com',

        // Optional
        name: 'Foo Bar',

        // Optional for most providers
        username: 'my-provider-username'
    }
})
```

<Callout>
It is highly recommended that Sandboxes where git credentials are used, are not exposed to the public. Even though we store the token in the isolated `~/private` folder, there are still some security concerns. 
</Callout>

### Environment variables

If you pass environment variables, these variables will be available to the user inside the commands and terminals that they run in the Sandbox.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = await sandbox.connect({
  id: 'anonymous',
  env: {
    FOO: 'bar'
  }
})

const output = await session.commands.run('echo $FOO')
console.log(output) // bar
```

### Host Tokens

Passing a host token to the session will ensure that you generate valid urls for private hosts.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const hostToken = await sdk.hosts.createToken()

const session = await sandbox.connect({
  id: 'some-user-reference',
  hostToken
})

const url = await session.hosts.getUrl(5173)

console.log(url)
```

## Storage

Every session will have the same filesystem as the global session. This means that if one user creates a file inside the workspace folder (or even the home folder), other users will be able to see it with one exception. The `~/.private` folder will be private for each session. No other session (including the global session) will be able to read or write to files inside this folder.

<Callout>
The `~/.private` folder will not be persisted between restarts of the sandbox. This means that files inside this folder will disappear between restarts. 
</Callout>
