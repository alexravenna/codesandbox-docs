# Update Sandbox

You can update certain properties of your Sandbox after creation.

```ts
import { VMTier } from '@codesandbox/sdk'

const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.resume('sandbox-id')

// You can hot swap the VM tier
await sandbox.updateTier(VMTier.Micro)
await sandbox.updateHibernationTimeout(60)
```

<Callout>
You can not update the `ipcountry` of a created Sandbox. This is because the IP country is set when the Sandbox is created and is used to determine the region the Sandbox is running in.
