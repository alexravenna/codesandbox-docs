# Resuming Sandboxes

Resuming allows you to wake up a hibernated sandbox and reconnect to it, restoring it to its exact previous state including file system, memory, and running processes.

## Resuming a Sandbox

To resume an existing sandbox from hibernation call: `sdk.sandboxes.resume(id)`:

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.resume('sandbox-id');
```

This will:

1. Restore the sandbox from its hibernated snapshot
2. Resume all processes that were running
3. Restore network connections and file system state
4. Return a sandbox instance

## Clean Bootups

The Sandbox will only be able to directly resume its state if it has a memory snapshot. If we are unable to resume from a memory snapshot the Sandbox will need to run its setup tasks again. This ensures your environment is properly initialized even after extended hibernation.

### Server

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.resume('sandbox-id');

if (sandbox.bootupType === 'CLEAN') {
  const client = await sandbox.connect()
  const steps = await clients.setup.getSteps()

  for (const step of setupSteps) {
    await step.waitUntilComplete()
  }
}
```

### Client

```ts
const client = await connectToSandbox({
   session,
   getSession: (id) => fetchJSON(`/api/sandboxes/${id}`)
})

if (client.bootupType === 'CLEAN') {
  const steps = await clients.setup.getSteps()

  for (const step of setupSteps) {
    console.log(`Step: ${step.name}`);
    console.log(`Command: ${step.command}`);
    console.log(`Status: ${step.status}`);

    const output = await step.open()
    output.onOutput((output) => console.log(output))
    await step.waitUntilComplete()
  }
}
```

## Agent Updates

Every Sandbox has an agent running on it. This agent is what allows you to interact with the Sandbox environment.

When a new version of the agent is published, existing sandboxes will need to restart before they get new version.

You can check if the current sandbox is up to date using `isUpToDate()`:

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.resume('sandbox-id')

if (!sandbox.isUpToDate) {
    await sdk.sandboxes.restart(sandbox.id)
}
```

It is up to you to decide what the best user experience will be for your use case. At CodeSandbox we would show a notification when the agent was out of date and the user could choose when to update.

## âš¡ Best practices

- **Track bootupType** - Resume times vary from 1-3 seconds (regular) to 10-60 seconds (archived Sandbox), use the bootupType to detect what UX to introduce
- **Avoid automatic HTTP wakeup** - As Sandboxes are archived after period of inactivity, waking it up from a preview url can create a blocking UX. Rather implement a proxy through your server to better manage the UX
