The CodeSandbox SDK provides a complete cloud development infrastructure that allows you to programmatically create, manage, and interact with isolated development environments. This page explains the conceptual architecture and terminology to help you understand how Sandboxes can integrate with your product.

## Integration Points

The SDK can be used across your stack to manage different parts of the user experience you are creating.

### Your repo

- Define one or multiple templates
- Build the templates manually or configure CI

### Your Server

- Create Sandboxes from your template(s)
- Hibernate Sandboxes
- Resume Sandboxes
- Backup and delete stale Sandboxes
- Proxy requests to Sandbox hosts
- Connect to Sandboxes to interact

### Your Client(s)

- Connect to Sandboxes to interact
- In browser create previews that you can interact with

## Sandbox Types

### Templates

**Templates** are pre-configured environment snapshots that serve as the foundation for creating Sandboxes. Think of them as "golden images" that contain:

- Pre-installed dependencies
- Environment configuration using Devcontainers and/or Docker
- Setup tasks and workflows
- Running processes for optimal continutation creating Sandboxes

### Sandboxes

**Sandboxes** are isolated virtual machines (Firecracker VMs) running your development environments. Each Sandbox:

- Runs completely isolated from others
- Has persistent file storage
- Can be hibernated and resumed with full state preservation
- Exposes services through secure host URLs

## The Sandbox Lifecycle

Understanding how sandboxes and templates progress through a development lifecycle is key to integrating CodeSandbox effectively. An end user may interact with a Sandbox directly, or indirectly through an agent (such as a connected service or automated workflow). Depending on the development flow that you are creating, you will need to mindful about managing the lifcycle of the Sandbox.

### Template creation

- Creates an optimal starting point for users
- Build templates using the SDK
- Optimized VM snapshots are generated and scheduled to multiple clusters

### Sandbox creation

- A user wants to create a new Sandbox
- Create Sandbox from template using the SDK
- The template is forked from cluster X in 1-3s

### User interaction

- A user/agent wants to interact with the Sandbox
- Connect to the Sandbox using the SDK
- Sandbox Agent handles interactions

### Host interaction

- A user wants to interact with a host
- Generate secure URL using the SDK
- Sandbox Proxy connects to the process in the Sandbox

### Hibernation

- A user/agent ends their session
- Hibernate the Sandbox using the SDK
- A snapshot is generated for instant continutation

### Resume from hibernation

- A user starts a new session on the same Sandbox within 2 days
- Resume the Sandbox using the SDK
- Sandbox continues from snapshot in 0.5-2s

### Deleting

- A user has not returned for 2 days
- Push persistence to git/db using the SDK and delete the Sandbox
- Sandbox and persistence deleted from infra

### Resume from deletion

- A user decides to come back after several days
- Create Sandbox from template using SDK. Pull persistence from git/db
- The template is forked from cluster X in 1-3s
