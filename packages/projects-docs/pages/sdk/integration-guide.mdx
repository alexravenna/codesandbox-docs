## Integration points

### 1. Template Creation

1. Define initial files and dependencies of the template
2. Add tasks and environment configuration
3. Use CLI to deploy optimized snapshots across global clusters

### 2. Sandbox Management

1. Create new Sandboxes from templates (~1-3 seconds)
2. Resume existing Sandboxes (~0.5-2 seconds)
3. Establish connections to Sandboxes for agent/end user interactions

### 3. Lifecycle Management

1. Persist Sandbox lifecycle state and meta data
2. Cost/UX management by hibernating Sandboxes
3. Delete Sandboxes after 2 days of inactivity for optimal archived resume
