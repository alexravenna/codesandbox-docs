# Sandbox Lifecycle

By default a Sandbox will be created from a template. A template is a memory/fs snapshot of a Sandbox, meaning it will be a direct continuation of the template. If the template was running a dev server, that dev server is running when the Sandbox is created.

When you create, resume or restart a Sandbox you can access its `bootupType`. This value indicates how the Sandbox was started.

- **FORK**: The Sandbox was created from a template. This happens when you call `create` successfully.
- **RUNNING**: The Sandbox was already running. This happens when you call `resume` and the Sandbox was already running.
- **RESUME**: The Sandbox was resumed from hibernation. This happens when you call `resume` and the Sandbox was hibernated.
- **CLEAN**: The Sandbox was created or resumed from scratch. This happens when you call `create` or `resume` and the Sandbox was not running and was missing a snapshot. This can happen if the Sandbox was shut down, restarted, the snapshot was expired (old snapshot) or if something went wrong.

## Managing CLEAN bootups

Whenever we boot a sandbox from scratch, we'll:

1. Start the Firecracker VM
2. Create a default user (called `pitcher-host`)
3. (optional) Build the Docker image specified in the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file
4. Start the Docker container
5. Mount the `/project/sandbox` directory as a volume inside the Docker container

You will be able to connect to the Sandbox during this process and track its progress.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()

if (sandbox.bootupType === 'CLEAN') {
  const session = await sandbox.connect()
  const setupSteps = session.setup.getSteps()

  for (const step of setupSteps) {
    console.log(`Step: ${step.name}`);
    console.log(`Command: ${step.command}`);
    console.log(`Status: ${step.status}`);

    const output = await step.open()

    output.onOutput((output) => {
      console.log(output)
    })

    await step.waitUntilComplete()
  }
}
```

If you want to show this setup as a client UX you can rather create a browser session and show the setup in the browser.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()

if (sandbox.bootupType === 'CLEAN') {
  const browserSession = await sandbox.createBrowserSession()

  return browserSession
}
```

And then in the browser:

```ts
import { connectToSandbox } from '@codesandbox/sdk'

const session = await connectToSandbox({
  session: browserSession
})

const setupSteps = session.setup.getSteps()

for (const step of setupSteps) {
  const output = await step.open()
  // Show output in UI

  output.onOutput((output) => {
    // Show output in UI
  })

  await step.waitUntilComplete()
}
```
