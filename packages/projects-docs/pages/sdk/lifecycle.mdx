# Sandbox Lifecycle

By default a Sandbox will be created from a template. A template is a snapshot of a Sandbox, meaning it will be a direct continuation of the template. If the template was running a dev server, that dev server is running when the Sandbox is created.

When you create, resume or restart a Sandbox you can access its `bootupType`. This value indicates how the Sandbox was started.

- **FORK**: The Sandbox was created from a template. This happens when you call `create` successfully.
- **RUNNING**: The Sandbox was already running. This happens when you call `resume` and the Sandbox was already running.
- **RESUME**: The Sandbox was resumed from hibernation. This happens when you call `resume` and the Sandbox was hibernated.
- **CLEAN**: The Sandbox was created or resumed from scratch. This happens when you call `create` or `resume` and the Sandbox was not running and was missing a snapshot. This can happen if the Sandbox was shut down, restarted, the snapshot was expired (old snapshot) or if something went wrong.

It is important to handle the **CLEAN** bootup. Please read more in [this guide](/sdk/bootups).
