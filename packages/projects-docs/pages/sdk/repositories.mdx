# Repositories

By default a Sandbox works like a repository. It has a `.git` folder and it pushes to a remote file system when the Sandbox hibernates.

If you rather want to use an existing remote repository, you can do so by simply cloning a repository to the sandbox.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const client = await sandbox.connect({
    id: 'some-user-reference',
    git: {
        // required
        email: 'foo@bar.com',
        name: "foo" // Optional, defaults to session id

        // Optionally set credentials
        accessToken: '...',
        provider: 'github.com',
        username: "foo" // Optional, defaults to x-access-token
    }
})

await client.commands.run("git clone https://github.com/my-org/my-project.git")
```

This will clone the repository to a nested folder.

<Callout>
Currently we do not support replacing the workspace `.git` persistence mechanism. That means you should not update that to a new remote. This will risk loss of data when archiving the Sandbox. This will be supported when the SDK Sandboxes are properly decoupled from the CodeSandbox product.
