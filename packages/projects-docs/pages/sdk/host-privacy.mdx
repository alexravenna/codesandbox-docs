# Host Privacy

CodeSandbox SDK supports different privacy levels for sandboxes and their hosts. Understanding these privacy levels helps you control access to your sandbox environments.

## Privacy Levels

- **`public`** - Sandbox and its hosts are publicly accessible to anyone
- **`unlisted`** ⚠️ **(deprecated)** - Use `public` or `public-hosts` instead  
- **`private`** - Sandbox is private and hosts require authentication via host tokens
- **`public-hosts`** - Sandbox is private but hosts are publicly accessible without tokens

## Private Sandboxes with Host Tokens

If a sandbox has `private` privacy, its hosts won't be accessible unless a host token is provided.

You can obtain a host token by calling `sdk.hosts.createToken`. This token will by default never expire. It is recommended to persist this token and provide it in dedicated Sandbox sessions.

## Public Hosts for Private Sandboxes

The new `public-hosts` privacy setting allows you to create private sandboxes where the hosts (preview URLs) remain publicly accessible. This is useful when you want:

- Private sandbox content and source code
- Public preview URLs for sharing demos or prototypes
- No authentication required for accessing the running application

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create({
  privacy: 'public-hosts', // Private sandbox with public hosts
  // ... other options
});

// Hosts are accessible without tokens
const previewUrl = `https://${sandbox.id}-3000.csb.app`;
```

You create signed urls to your Sandboxes using the `hosts` API on the server:

```ts
const hostToken = await sdk.hosts.createToken('sandbox-id')
```

This gives you low level management of your Sandboxes hosts. But you can also pass the host token to a session. This is especially useful if you want to generate urls based on the state of the Sandbox, generating them in browser sessions etc.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const hostToken = await sdk.hosts.createToken(sandbox.id)
const session = await sandbox.createSession({
  id: 'some-user-reference',
  hostToken
})
```

When you open a signed URL in the browser, we will automatically put the preview token in a
cookie so subsequent requests from the same browser don't require the token.
</Callout>

## Token expiration

You can set an expiration on the preview token when creating it:

```ts
const hostToken = await sdk.hosts.createToken('sandbox-id', {
  expiresAt: new Date(Date.now() + 60 * 60 * 1000) // 1 hour
})
```

This is useful if you want to limit the lifetime of a host token. For example when a user shared a preview of their app with someone who should only have access for a limited time.

### Managing Host Tokens (CLI)

The CLI allows you to manage host tokens of a sandbox. You can use it to list, revoke and update host tokens.

#### List:

```
$ csb sandbox host-tokens :sandbox-id list
 ID                           PREFIX        LAST USED   EXPIRES
 prv_Hca52PUyFHVJsGkciXXbEq   prv_v1_8uKY   Never       Never
 prv_HbE8wC6veXWwcazFYrdUfy   prv_v1__ki7   Never       Never
 prv_MWMhMjbQiY3jSagfaG6D7R   prv_v1_i7iI   Never       Never
```

#### Revoke:

```
$ csb sandbox host-tokens :sandbox-id revoke prv_Hca52PUyFHVJsGkciXXbEq
```

If you want to revoke all host tokens for a sandbox, you can do so with:

```
$ csb sandbox host-tokens :sandbox-id revoke --all
```

#### Update:

Extend or shorten the expiration time of a host token:

```
$ csb sandbox host-tokens :sandbox-id update prv_Hca52PUyFHVJsGkciXXbEq --expires-at 2025-03-01
```
