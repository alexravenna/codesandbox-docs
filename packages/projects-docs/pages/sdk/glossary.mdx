# Glossary

- **API Key**: Authentication token required to use the CodeSandbox SDK. Created at [https://codesandbox.io/t/api](https://codesandbox.io/t/api) and exposed as `CSB_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **Browser Client**: A client connection that runs in a web browser environment, allowing interaction with sandboxes from frontend applications.

- **Client**: A connection object that provides methods to interact with a sandbox, including file system operations, command execution, and terminal management.

- **Commands**: Interface for running shell commands in a sandbox. Commands clean themselves up after execution, unlike terminals which persist.

- **Dev Container**: Container configuration system used by CodeSandbox for environment setup. Uses `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for configuration.

- **Firecracker VM**: The virtualization technology that powers each sandbox, providing complete isolation and security for running untrusted code.

- **Fork**: Creating a new sandbox from an existing sandbox. A "Live Fork" creates from a running sandbox (slower), while forking from hibernated sandboxes or templates is faster.

- **Hibernation**: Automatic suspension of sandbox execution after a specified timeout period. Sandboxes can be resumed later while preserving their state.

- **Host Token**: Authentication token required to access hosts of private sandboxes. Provides secure access to sandbox ports and services.

- **Hosts**: The publicly accessible URLs where sandbox services are exposed, following the pattern `https://$SANDBOX_ID-$PORT.csb.app`.

- **Live Fork**: Creating a sandbox from a currently running sandbox, which is slower than forking from templates or hibernated sandboxes.

- **Node Client**: A client connection designed for Node.js-like environments, such as React Native applications.

- **Ports**: Network endpoints exposed by sandbox services. Automatically detected or manually configured in task definitions.

- **Resume**: Resumes a hibernated sandbox, restoring it to an active state while preserving all previous work and configurations.

- **Sandbox**: An isolated, persistent virtual environment backed by a Firecracker VM where code can be executed securely.

- **Session**: Authentication and connection context that allows client applications to interact with sandboxes.

- **Setup Tasks**: Commands that run automatically after a sandbox starts, typically used for dependency installation and initial configuration.

- **Snapshots**: Disk/Memory snapshot that is generated when hibernating a Sandbox and consumed when resuming a Sandbox.

- **Tasks**: Long-running processes defined in sandbox configuration, such as development servers. Managed through the Tasks API with start, stop, and restart capabilities.

- **Template**: Pre-configured environment specification that enables quick sandbox creation with specific setups, dependencies, and configurations.

- **Terminal**: Interactive shell process that persists throughout a session, allowing command-line interaction with the sandbox environment.

- **VM Tier**: Computing resource specification for sandboxes, ranging from Micro to Small (8 cores/16GB RAM) with higher tiers available through custom templates.

- **Workspace**: The persistent working directory (`/project/workspace`) where sandbox files are stored and managed with git-based persistence.
