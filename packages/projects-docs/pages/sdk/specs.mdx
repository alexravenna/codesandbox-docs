# VM Specs

Whenever you start a sandbox, you can specify which VM specs to use. This allows you to customize the VM to your needs. We also allow you to change the VM specs of a running sandbox on the fly,
without reboot. This is useful if you want to scale up or down your sandbox dynamically based on workload needs.

<Callout>
  SDK Sandbox VMTier parameters can be used to create/update environments up to **Small (8 Cores/16GB RAM) specs**. If higher tiers are specified only the core count will increase unless you create a custom snapshot using the CLI.
</Callout>

## Specifying VM Specs when starting your Sandbox

You can start a sandbox with a specific VM tier by passing the `vmTier` option to the `sandbox.create` method:

```ts
import { CodeSandbox, VMTier } from "@codesandbox/sdk";

const sdk = new CodeSandbox();
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create({
  source: 'template',
  vmTier: VMTier.Small
});
```

You can also approximate the VM size:

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create({
  source: 'template',
  vmTier: VMTier.fromSpecs({ cpu: 4, memGiB: 8 }),
});
```

This will pick the smallest VM tier that can fit the specs you provided.

## Changing VM Specs

You can change the VM specs of a running sandbox by calling the `sandbox.updateTier` method:

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.resume('some-id')

await sandbox.updateTier(VMTier.Medium);
```

This will change the VM specs of the sandbox dynamically, without rebooting.

  Be careful when scaling down the VM specs of a running sandbox. If you scale down the VM too much, it might not have enough resources to run your tasks and will slow to a crawl.
