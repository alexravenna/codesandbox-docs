# How To Integrate

The CodeSandbox SDK provides a complete cloud development infrastructure that allows you to programmatically create, manage, and interact with isolated development environments. This page explains the conceptual architecture and terminology to help you understand how Sandboxes integrate with your product.

## Core Architecture

At its heart, the SDK enables management of and connections to Sandboxes. You have a lot of flexibility on how you want to deliver secure, scalable development environments:

## Key Concepts

### Templates

**Templates** are pre-configured environment snapshots that serve as the foundation for creating Sandboxes. Think of them as "golden images" that contain:

- Pre-installed dependencies
- Environment configuration using Devcontainers and/or Docker
- Setup tasks and workflows
- Running processes for optimal continutation creating Sandboxes

### Sandboxes

**Sandboxes** are isolated virtual machines (Firecracker VMs) running your development environments. Each Sandbox:

- Runs completely isolated from others
- Has persistent file storage
- Can be hibernated and resumed with full state preservation
- Exposes services through secure host URLs

## The Sandbox Lifecycle

Understanding how Sandboxes move through their lifecycle is crucial for effective integration. You are building a product, a product with end users that has some concept of a _project_. This project has at least one Sandbox assigned to it for the end user to interact with or maybe an agent. This diagram touches on the integration points through the lifecycle of a project VS a Sandbox.

## Integration points

### 1. Template Creation

1. Define initial files and dependencies of the template
2. Add tasks and environment configuration
3. Use CLI to deploy optimized snapshots across global clusters

### 2. Sandbox Management

1. Create new Sandboxes from templates (~1-3 seconds)
2. Resume existing Sandboxes (~0.5-2 seconds)
3. Establish connections to Sandboxes for agent/end user interactions

### 3. Lifecycle Management

1. Persist Sandbox lifecycle state and meta data
2. Cost/UX management by hibernating Sandboxes
3. Delete Sandboxes after 2 days of inactivity for optimal archived resume
