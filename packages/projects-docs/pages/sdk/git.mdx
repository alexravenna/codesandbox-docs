# Git

When passing `git` information to the session, the session will be able to perform git commands. This can be done in a terminal, running commands programmatically or using the `git` API. The API is designed to make git more accessible for the common use cases.

## API

The Git API is available under `client.git`.

### Clone

Clone a repository to the sandbox.

```ts
await client.git.clone('https://github.com/codesandbox/sandbox.git')
```

<Callout>
It depends on the repo how you want to setup the sandbox. If it is configured with tasks you can run `client.setup.run()` to run the full setup, but if configured with a `.devcontainer` you want to restart the sandbox itself.
</Callout>

### Status

Get the current status of the branch. You can also listen to status changes.

```ts
const status = await client.git.status()

console.log(status)

const disposer = client.git.onStatus((status) => {
  console.log(status)
})

// Stop listening
disposer()
```

### Commit

Commit the current changes to the branch. This will do a `git add .` as well.

```ts
await client.git.commit("Some message")
```

### Push

Push the current branch to the remote, this ensures the upstream is set.

```ts
await client.git.push()
```

## Nested Git Repos

You can also use `commands` to run git commands manually. This allows you to clone repos to nested folders and manage them as you see fit.

```ts
await client.commands.run('git clone https://github.com/codesandbox/sandbox.git ./nested-repo')
```
