# File System

Every sandbox has a persistent file system in the default working directory: `/project/workspace`. All files saved in `/project/workspace` have `git` source control and will be persisted between reboots. Whenever we hibernate or shutdown a sandbox, we create a commit to track the filesystem of the sandbox.

Refer to the [Environment](/sdk/environment) section for more information about how we store files and other resources.

## API

The API of the filesystem is similar to the Node.js fs module. You can find the API under `sandbox.fs`. All filesystem
operations are relative to the workspace directory of the sandbox (which is `/project/workspace` by default).

### Writing & Reading Files

You can read & write files using an api that's similer to the Node.js fs module:

```ts
// Writing text files
await client.fs.writeTextFile("./hello.txt", "Hello, world!");

// Reading text files
const content = await client.fs.readTextFile("./hello.txt");
console.log(content);

// Writing binary files
await client.fs.writeFile("./hello.bin", new Uint8Array([1, 2, 3]));

// Reading binary files
const content = await client.fs.readFile("./hello.bin");
console.log(content);
```

### Uploading & Downloading Files

Uploading and downloading files can be done using the same methods.

```ts
import fs from "node:fs";

const myBinaryFile = fs.readFileSync("./my-binary-file");
await client.fs.writeFile("./my-binary-file", myBinaryFile);

const content = await client.fs.readFile("./my-binary-file");
fs.writeFileSync("./my-binary-file", content);
```

You can also download a file or directory as a zip file by generating a download URL. This URL is valid for 5 minutes:

```ts
const { downloadUrl } = await client.fs.download("./");
console.log(downloadUrl);
```

### Listing Files & Directories

You can list files & directories in a directory using the `readdir` method.

```ts
const filesOrDirs = await client.fs.readdir("./");

console.log(filesOrDirs);
```

### Copying, Renaming & Deleting Files

You can copy, rename & delete files using the `copy`, `rename` & `remove` methods.

```ts
await client.fs.copy("./hello.txt", "./hello-copy.txt");
await client.fs.rename("./hello-copy.txt", "./hello-renamed.txt");
await client.fs.remove("./hello-renamed.txt");
```

### Watching Files

You can watch files for file changes, additions and deletions using the `watch` method.

```ts
const watcher = await client.fs.watch("./", { recursive: true, excludes: [".git"] });

watcher.onEvent((event) => {
  console.log(event);
});

// When you're done, you can stop the watcher
watcher.dispose();
```

## Storage (Mounts)

You can learn more about the different folders to store files in the [Sessions](/sdk/sessions) documentation.
