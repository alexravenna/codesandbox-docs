# Restart & Shutdown

## Restart

Restarting a Sandbox won't use a snapshot and will start from scratch. It will install and build its configured resources (including your files in `/project/workspace`) and also run with the latest version of the agent.

```ts
let sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.resume('sandbox-id')

sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.restart(sandbox.id);
```

<Callout>
Note that when restarting you get a new reference to the Sandbox. You will need to create a new session from that new reference.
</Callout>

## Shutdown

You can also shutdown a sandbox without creating a snapshot. Once shut down the Sandbox will need to boot from a clean state (but your files in `/project/workspace` will be preserved).

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.resume('sandbox-id')

await sdk.sandboxes.shutdown(sandbox.id);
```

Generally you should shutdown a sandbox if you want to come back to your project in a fresh instance.
