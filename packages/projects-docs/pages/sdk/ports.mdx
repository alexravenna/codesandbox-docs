# Ports

The Ports API allows you to monitor and interact with HTTP ports in your sandbox. This is particularly useful when working with development servers or any other services that need to listen on specific ports.

Whenever a port is opened within a sandbox, we'll automatically expose it under `https://<sandbox-id>-<port>.csb.app`.

<Callout>
If the sandbox is private you need to use the [host tokens](./hosts).
</Callout>

We automatically resume a sandbox whenever a port is accessed while the sandbox is hibernated.

## API

The Ports API is available under `client.ports`. It provides methods for monitoring port activity.

### Monitoring Ports

You can listen for ports being opened and closed in your sandbox:

```ts
// Listen for ports being opened
const listener1 = client.ports.onDidPortOpen((portInfo) => {
  console.log(`Port ${portInfo.port} opened`);
  console.log(`URL: ${client.hosts.getUrl(portInfo.port)}`);
});

// Listen for ports being closed
const listener2 = client.ports.onDidPortClose((port) => {
  console.log(`Port ${port} closed`);
});

// Remove listeners when done
listener1.dispose();
listener2.dispose();
```

### Getting Port Information

You can get information about currently opened ports:

```ts
// Get all opened ports
const openPorts = client.ports.getAll();
for (const port of openPorts) {
  console.log(`Port ${port.port} is open at ${port.host}`);
}
```

### Waiting for Ports

When starting services, you often need to wait for a port to become available:

```ts
// Start a development server
const command = client.commands.runBackground("npm run dev");

// Wait for the dev server port to open
const portInfo = await client.ports.waitForPort(3000);
console.log(`Dev server is ready at: ${portInfo.host}`);
```
