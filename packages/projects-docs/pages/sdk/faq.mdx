# FAQ

## Do I need a CodeSandbox workspace to be able to use the SDK?

Yes. You need a CodeSandbox API key to use CodeSandbox SDK, which you can get by [creating a CodeSandbox account](https://codesandbox.io/signin).

## How can I revoke my API key?

To revoke an API key, go to the "Permissions" tab of your [Workspace Settings](https://codesandbox.io/t/permissions) and click the respective token under "API Access". Then, click "Remove Token" from the bottom of that modal.

## Are there any SDK rate limits?

Yes. The SDK has rate limits on concurrent VMs, number of requests per hour, and number of sandboxes created per hour. These limits vary depending on the CodeSandbox plan, as explained on our [Pricing page](https://codesandbox.io/pricing).

## I have hit a rate limit - what should I do?

If you're on our free plan, you can upgrade to Scale with increased limits straight away through our [Pricing page](https://codesandbox.io/pricing). If you're already on Scale, please [contact our sales team](https://www.together.ai/contact-sales) to discuss an Enterprise plan.

## My iframe previews always show a confirmation prompt. Can I remove this?

Yes! This prompt has been implemented as a part of our phishing prevention measures. You can remove it by taking out any [Pro plan](https://codesandbox.io/pricing) on the account that you're using with CodeSandbox SDK.

## Does the CodeSandbox SDK use VM or Browser Sandboxes?

While the SDK code only mentions "sandbox", the actual environments that it uses run in a VM. If you need more details about these VMs, please refer to the "[VM Sandboxes](/learn/vm-sandboxes/overview)" section of the CodeSandbox documentation for further information and pricing.

## Are VMs created by the SDK covered by any cybersecurity certifications?

CodeSandbox and its infrastructure, including VMs are SOC 2 Type II compliant. You can read our SOC 2 announcement on our [blog](https://codesandbox.io/blog/codesandbox-is-now-soc-2-compliant)

## Can I change the specs of the VMs?

Yes. You can change your VM tier using the steps detailed [here](https://codesandbox.io/docs/sdk/specs)

## Is it possible to self-host CodeSandbox SDK?

No, we do not offer self hosting at this time. 

## Can I use the same CodeSandbox plan for SDK and non-SDK usage?

Yes. Your CodeSandbox plan will allow you to use both, so you can leverage the SDK for programmatic sandbox creation, while still allowing your team to use CodeSandbox for their development.
