# Commands

The Commands API allows you to run commands in your Sandbox. A command is also a shell, but unlike a terminal it will clean itself up after the command is executed.

## API

The Commands API is available under `sandbox.commands`.

### Running Commands

```ts
// Run until completion, also supports an array of commands
const output = await client.commands.run("npm install");

console.log(output)

// Listen to changes
const cmd = await client.commands.runBackground("npm install", {
  name: 'my command'
});

cmd.command // "npm install"
cmd.name // "my command"

// Open the command to get its current output. Required to get output events.
const output = await cmd.open()

const disposer = cmd.onOutput((output) => {
  console.log(output)
})

const finalOutput = await cmd.waitUntilComplete()

// Run it again
await cmd.restart()
```

## Long running commands

Some commands take longer to run, like starting a server. In this case you can use the `waitForPort` method to wait for the port to open:

```ts
// Run a long running command
const command = client.commands.runBackground("npx -y serve .");

// Wait for the port to open
const portInfo = await client.ports.waitForPort(3000);

// You will need to manually kill it
command.kill()

// Or you can also restart a command that is already running
command.restart()
```

For long running commands you should evaluate using [tasks](/sdk/tasks.mdx).
