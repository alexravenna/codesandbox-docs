# Terminals

A terminal is a shell process which you can write to, listen to and is often combined with xTerm in the browser to allow users to get a full terminal experience.

The Terminals API allows you to create, manage and interact with terminal processes in your sandbox.

## API

The Terminals API is available under `sandbox.terminals`.

### Creating Terminals

You can create an interactive terminal that allows you to write, run commands and receive output:

```ts
// Create a new terminal (bash is default)
const terminal = client.terminals.create()

// Open the terminal to get its current output. Required to get output events.
const output = await terminal.open();

// Listen to terminal output
const onOutputDisposer = terminal.onOutput((output) => {
  console.log(output);
});

// Run commands
await terminal.run("echo 'Hello, world!'");

// Kill the terminal when done
await terminal.kill();

// Dispose the listener when done
onOutputDisposer.dispose();
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
Typically you want terminals to live beyond the immediate session of the user. Use the `session.terminals.getAll()` method to retrieve any existing terminals.

### Browser Terminal

The terminal API is often combined with [xTerm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xterm/xterm) to allow users to get a full terminal experience. In combination with [local-echo](https://github.com/wavesoft/local-echo) you can give your users an excellent terminal experience in the browser.

```ts

import { Terminal } from '@xterm/xterm'

const terminal = await client.terminals.create()
const xterm = new Terminal()

xterm.open(document.getElementById('terminal'))

// Open to get current output and subscribe to output events
const output = await terminal.open();

xterm.write(output)

terminal.onOutput((output) => {
  xterm.write(output)
});

xterm.onData((data) => {
  terminal.write(data)
})
```
