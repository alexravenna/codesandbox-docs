# Shells

Shells is an important component of the CodeSandbox SDK. To give you the best possible developer experience working with shells we abstracted them into the following concepts:

- **Commands** is a shell instance of the session bound to a single command
- **Terminals** is a shell instance of the session you can interact with
- **Tasks** is a global shell instance bound to a single command that can be configured to automatically run on Sandbox start, fork or file changes. Any ports opened is also bound to this task
- **Setup Step** is a global shell instance bound to a setup step that runs when the sandbox is created

## Commands

Just run a single command in a shell which you can wait for output. It is intended to be used for short running commands.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = await sandbox.connect()

const output = await session.commands.run("npm install");
```

## Terminals

Terminals are a shell that you can interact with. It can live beyond the immediate session of the user. Use the `session.terminals.getAll()` method to retrieve any existing terminals.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = await sandbox.connect()

// Create a new terminal (bash is default)
const terminal = session.terminals.create()

// Open the terminal to get its current output. Required to get output events.
const output = await terminal.open();

// Listen to terminal output
const onOutputDisposer = terminal.onOutput((output) => {
    console.log(output);
});

// Write input, from for example xTerm
await terminal.write("hello");

// Run commands
await terminal.run("echo 'Hello, world!'");

// Kill the terminal when done
await terminal.kill();
```

## Tasks

Tasks are defined by the project and runs shells with the global user. Any ports opened by the shells are bound to the task. You can retrieve a task by name and it is shared by all sessions.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = await sandbox.connect()

const task = session.tasks.get("dev")
const output = await task.open()

// Listen to task output
const onOutputDisposer = task.onOutput((output) => {
    console.log(output);
});

// Restart the task
task.restart()
```

## Setup Steps

When handling the setup of Sandbox the setup steps are also shells.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = await sandbox.connect()

const steps = await session.setup.getSteps()

for (const step of steps) {
    console.log(`Step: ${step.name}`);
    console.log(`Command: ${step.command}`);
    console.log(`Status: ${step.status}`);

    const output = await step.open()

    output.onOutput((output) => {
        console.log(output)
    })

    await step.waitUntilComplete()
}
```
