# Sessions

To connect to a Sandbox you need to create a session.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="âš¡">
**Best practices**

The `id` of a user session becomes the OS user, so use a relatable username here. Do not randomize the `id` as it will create a new OS user on every connection, which is inefficient and can cause issues with file permissions and user data persistence.

- **Use consistent user identifiers** - The session ID should be stable and meaningful (e.g., username, user ID)
- **Avoid random session IDs** - Each unique ID creates a new OS user, consuming resources unnecessarily
- **Consider file ownership** - Files created by different session IDs will have different owners
- **Plan for persistence** - User-specific data (like shell history) is tied to the session ID
- **Keep it readable** - Use identifiers that make sense when debugging or logging
</Callout>

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = await sandbox.createSession({ id: 'some-session-ref' })

// When connecting on your server you can configure
// the session directly when connecting
const client = await sandbox.connect({ id: 'some-session-ref' })
```

You can create a session without passing an argument. This will create a session bound to a user called `pitcher-host`. This user has write access to any API. We refer to this session as the "global" session.

<Callout>
When you run `whoami`, it will say that you are `root`. That's because we run every session inside a Docker container where you are `root`. However the container itself is started as the user of your session.
</Callout>

## User Sessions

You should use user sessions for your users. This ensures privacy and isolation between users. You can configure a user session to have specific permissions, git access, tokens to securily access private hosts and even environment variables.

### Permissions

By default a user has `write` access, but you can configure a user session to have `read` access.

```ts
// Now configure a user session that only has read access to the sandbox
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = sandbox.createSession({
  id: 'anonymous',
  permission: 'read'
})
```

### Git

Passing git details allows the user to use git commands inside the sandbox.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = await sandbox.createSession({
    id: 'some-user-reference',
    git: {
        email: 'foo@bar.com', // Required
        name: 'Foo Bar', // Optional, defaults to session id

        // Optional credentials
        accessToken: '...',
        provider: 'github.com',
        username: 'my-provider-username' // Optional, defaults to x-access-token
    }
})
```

<Callout>
It is highly recommended that Sandboxes where git credentials are used, are not exposed to the public. Even though we store the token in the isolated `~/.private` folder, there are still some security concerns if the Sandbox is public or shared between multiple user sessions.
</Callout>

### Environment variables

If you pass environment variables, these variables will be available to the user inside the commands and terminals that they run in the Sandbox.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = await sandbox.createSession({
  id: 'anonymous',
  env: {
    FOO: 'bar'
  }
})
```

### Host Tokens

Passing a host token to the session will sign all url generation from the client APIs.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()

const hostToken = await sdk.hosts.createToken()

const session = await sandbox.createSession({
  id: 'some-user-reference',
  hostToken
})
```

## Storage

Every session will have the same filesystem as the global session. This means that if one user creates a file inside the workspace folder (or even the home folder), other users will be able to see it with one exception. The `~/.private` folder will be private for each session. No other session (including the global session) will be able to read or write to files inside this folder.

<Callout>
The `~/.private` folder will not be persisted between restarts of the sandbox. This means that files inside this folder will disappear between restarts. 
</Callout>
