# Sessions

To connect to a Sandbox you need to create a session.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = await sandbox.createSession({ ...userSession })

// When connecting on your server you can configure
// the session directly when connecting
const client = await sandbox.connect({ ...userSession })
```

You can create a session without passing an argument. This will create a session bound to a user called `pitcher-host`. This user has write access to any API. We refer to this session as the "global" session.

<Callout>
When you run `whoami`, it will say that you are `root`. That's because we run every session inside a Docker container where you are `root`. However the container itself is started as the user of your session.
</Callout>

## User Sessions

You should use user sessions for your users. This ensures privacy and isolation between users. You can configure a user session to have specific permissions, git access, tokens to securily access private hosts and even environment variables.

### Permissions

By default a user has `write` access, but you can configure a user session to have `read` access.

```ts
// Now configure a user session that only has read access to the sandbox
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = sandbox.createSession({
  id: 'anonymous',
  permission: 'read'
})
```

### Git

Passing git details allows the user to use git commands inside the sandbox.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = await sandbox.createSession({
    id: 'some-user-reference,
    git: {

        email: 'foo@bar.com',
        accessToken: '...',
        provider: 'github.com',

        // Optional
        name: 'Foo Bar',

        // Optional for most providers
        username: 'my-provider-username'
    }
})
```

<Callout>
It is highly recommended that Sandboxes where git credentials are used, are not exposed to the public. Even though we store the token in the isolated `~/.private` folder, there are still some security concerns. 
</Callout>

### Environment variables

If you pass environment variables, these variables will be available to the user inside the commands and terminals that they run in the Sandbox.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()
const session = await sandbox.createSession({
  id: 'anonymous',
  env: {
    FOO: 'bar'
  }
})
```

### Host Tokens

Passing a host token to the session will sign all url generation from the client APIs.

```ts
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create()

const hostToken = await sdk.hosts.createToken()

const session = await sandbox.createSession({
  id: 'some-user-reference',
  hostToken
})
```

## Storage

Every session will have the same filesystem as the global session. This means that if one user creates a file inside the workspace folder (or even the home folder), other users will be able to see it with one exception. The `~/.private` folder will be private for each session. No other session (including the global session) will be able to read or write to files inside this folder.

<Callout>
The `~/.private` folder will not be persisted between restarts of the sandbox. This means that files inside this folder will disappear between restarts. 
</Callout>
