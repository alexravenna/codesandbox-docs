CodeSandbox SDK enables you to quickly create and run isolated sandboxes securely.
The SDK can be used to run concurrent VMs to support multiple use cases such as browser editors, AI agents, code interpretation and more.

<Callout>
We are currently working on improvements to our infrastructure. Please read our [RFC](https://gist.github.com/christianalfoni/70335f989312484c8f348148aa2e166e) for planned deprecations and future roadmap. We would love your feedback!
</Callout>

## Quickstart

1. Create or log into your [CodeSandbox account](https://codesandbox.io/signin)

2. Next create an API key at [https://codesandbox.io/t/api](https://codesandbox.io/t/api), and enable all scopes. Expose it as `CSB_API_KEY` in your environment.

3. Install the SDK:

```bash
npm install @codesandbox/sdk
```

Your first interaction:

```js
import { CodeSandbox } from "@codesandbox/sdk";

const sdk = new CodeSandbox();
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create();
const client = await sandbox.connect();

const output = await client.commands.run("echo 'Hello World'");

console.log(output) // Hello World
```

## How to integrate

To understand how the SDK can be integrated into your product read the following pages:

- [**Core Concepts**](/sdk/core-concepts.mdx): It is all about templates, persistence and lifecycles
- [**Templates**](/sdk/templates.mdx): Drop your end users directly into an optimized running Sandbox
- [**Lifecycle Management**](/sdk/manage-sandboxes.mdx): Learn about managing cost VS optimizing UX
- [**Hosts**](/sdk/sandbox-hosts.mdx): Learn about creating an experience around the ports you want to expose from Sandboxes
