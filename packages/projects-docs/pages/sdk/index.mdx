CodeSandbox SDK enables you to quickly create and run isolated sandboxes securely.
The SDK can be used to run concurrent VMs to support multiple use cases such as browser editors, AI agents, code interpretation and [more](/sdk/use-cases.mdx)

<Callout type="info">
v3 is our **Best Practices** release of the SDK. It adjusts default options and prevents certain behavior. To learn more, take a look at the [v3.0.0 release](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-sdk/releases/tag/v3.0.0). Looking for v2 docs? You can find them [here](https://projects-docs-git-v2-codesandbox1.vercel.app/).

## Getting Started

1. Create or log into your [CodeSandbox account](https://codesandbox.io/signin)

2. Next create an API key at [https://codesandbox.io/t/api](https://codesandbox.io/t/api), and enable all scopes. Expose it as `CSB_API_KEY` in your environment.

3. Install the SDK:

```bash
npm install @codesandbox/sdk
```

Your first interaction:

```js
import { CodeSandbox } from "@codesandbox/sdk";

const sdk = new CodeSandbox();
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create();
const client = await sandbox.connect();

const output = await client.commands.run("echo 'Hello World'");

console.log(output) // Hello World
```
