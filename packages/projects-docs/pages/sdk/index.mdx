The CodeSandbox SDK has been designed to let you to rapidly create and run secure code environments at scale. The SDK is already supporting use cases such as:

- Browser based IDEs
- Code interpretation
- AI Agent runtime environments
- A/B testing

If your product or project has a need for concurrent VMs, sandboxed development environments and/or an isolated code interpreter. The CodeSandbox SDK has been built with you in mind.

<Callout>
We are currently working on improvements to our infrastructure. Please read our latest [Best Practices Release](https://github.com/codesandbox/codesandbox-sdk/releases/tag/v2.3.0) for more details. We would love your feedback!
</Callout>

## Quickstart

1. Create or log into your [CodeSandbox account](https://codesandbox.io/signin)

2. Next create an API key at [https://codesandbox.io/t/api](https://codesandbox.io/t/api), and enable all scopes. Expose it as `CSB_API_KEY` in your environment.

3. Install the SDK:

```bash
npm install @codesandbox/sdk
```

Your first interaction:

```js
import { CodeSandbox } from "@codesandbox/sdk";

const sdk = new CodeSandbox();
const sandbox = await sdk.sandboxes.create();
const client = await sandbox.connect();

const output = await client.commands.run("echo 'Hello World'");

console.log(output) // Hello World
```

## How to integrate

To understand how the SDK can be integrated into your product read the following pages:

- [**Key Terms**](/sdk/key-terms.mdx): Definitions for the terminology used throughout this documentation and within the SDK.
- [**Core Concepts**](/sdk/core-concepts.mdx): Learn about the underlying architecture of the SDK, and how to get the most out of it.
- [**Templates**](/sdk/templates.mdx): How to take your end users (or agent) straight into an optimized running Sandbox, built to your specifications.
- [**Lifecycle Management**](/sdk/manage-sandboxes.mdx): Our guide for setting up a Sandbox management layer, so you can optimise your SDK implementation for the best user experience at the lowest cost.
- [**Hosts**](/sdk/sandbox-hosts.mdx): Customise your user experience using the ports that you expose from Sandboxes. Set up custom domains for previews, your own error pages and more.
